% Basic setup. Most papers should leave these options alone.
\documentclass[fleqn,usenatbib]{mnras}

% MNRAS is set in Times font. If you don't have this installed (most LaTeX

\usepackage{newtxtext,newtxmath}
% Depending on your LaTeX fonts installation, you might get better results with one of these:
%\usepackage{mathptmx}
%\usepackage{txfonts}

% Use vector fonts, so it zooms properly in on-screen viewing software

The abstract should briefly describe the aims, methods, and main results of the paper.
It should be a single paragraph not more than 250 words (200 words for Letters).
No references should appear in the abstract.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% BODY OF PAPER %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\section{Introduction}

This is a simple template for authors to write new MNRAS papers.
See \texttt{mnras\_sample.tex} for a more complex example, and \texttt{mnras\_guide.tex}
for a full user guide.

All papers should start with an Introduction section, which sets the work
in context, cites relevant earlier studies in the field by \citet{Others2013},
and describes the problem the authors aim to solve \citep[e.g.][]{Author2012}.

\section{Dark Energy Survey Data}

General stuff about DES goes here.

\subsection{redmapper description}
\label{sec:redmapper} % used for referring to this section from elsewhere

\subsection{shape catalog description}

Figures and tables should be placed at logical positions in the text. Don't
worry about the exact layout, which will be handled by the publishers.

Figures are referred to as e.g. Fig.~\ref{fig:example_figure}, and tables as
e.g. Table~\ref{tab:example_table}.

% Example figure
\begin{figure}
	% To include a figure from a file named example.*
	% Allowable file formats are eps or ps if compiling using latex
	% or pdf, png, jpg if compiling using pdflatex
	%\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{example}
    \caption{This is an example figure. Captions appear below each figure.
	Give enough detail for the reader to understand what they're looking at,
	but leave detailed discussion to the main body of the text.}
    \label{fig:example_figure}
\end{figure}

% Example table
\begin{table}
	\centering
	\caption{This is an example table. Captions appear above each table.
	Remember to define the quantities, symbols and units used.}
	\label{tab:example_table}
	\begin{tabular}{lccr} % four columns, alignment for each
		\hline
		A & B & C & D\\
		\hline
		1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\
		2 & 4 & 6 & 8\\
		3 & 5 & 7 & 9\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{intrinsic alignment of galaxies}

Theory and previous results background

\subsection{internal alignment in galaxy clusters}

\subsection{measuring satellite galaxy distribution orientation}

We quantify the strength of the central galaxy alignment signal with two variables: the position angle difference between the central galaxy and its host cluster $\Delta \eta$, and the central galaxy alignment angle for each central-satellite pair $\theta_{cen}$. They are both defined to lie in the range $[0 \degree, 90 \degree]$, with values closer to $0 \degree$ indicating stronger central galaxy alignment.

Measuring $\Delta \eta$ requires an approximation of the overall cluster shape from the distribution of satellite galaxies. We use 2 different methods to determine the ellipticity and orientation of the cluster in order to 

\subsubsection{method 1}

We follow the method used by \citet{Huang16} to calculate the cluster ellipticity and position angle. We use all satellite galaxies with $p_{mem} \geq 0.2$ in order to reasonably trace the shape of the cluster. We first calculate the reduced second moments of the positions of all viable satellites in the cluster:
\begin{equation}
M_{xx} \equiv \frac{\sum_i p_{mem} \frac{x_i^2}{r_i^2}}{\sum_i p_{mem}}, M_{xy} \equiv \frac{\sum_i p_{mem} \frac{x_i y_i}{r_i^2}}{\sum_i p_{mem}}, M_{yy} \equiv \frac{\sum_i p_{mem} \frac{y_i^2}{r_i^2}}{\sum_i p_{mem}}
\end{equation}
where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are the distances of satellite galaxy $i$ from the central galaxy in RA and Dec, respectively.

\subsubsection{method 2}

\subsection{measuring alignment of satellites with central galaxy}

\section{results in DES redmapper clusters}

\subsection{alignment of central galaxy with satellite galaxy distribution}

\subsubsection{agreement between halo orientation and galaxy distribution}

\subsection{alignment of satellite galaxies}

\subsection{alignment of satellite galaxies with central galaxy}

\subsection{comparison with SDSS redmapper}

\subsection{intrinsic alignment dependence with redshift and cluster properties}

\section{Conclusions}

The last numbered section should briefly summarise what has been done, and describe
the final conclusions which the authors draw from their work.

colleagues, acknowledge funding agencies, telescopes and facilities used etc.
